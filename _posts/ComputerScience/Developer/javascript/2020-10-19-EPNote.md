# Notes

## Eloquent JavaScript

### Introduction

The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity.

A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules.

```javascript
49 / 448// sum up from 1 to 10
let total = 0,
  count = 1;

while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count++;
}

console.log(total);
```

A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level.

### Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zero and ones.

```javascript
2.998e8; // scientific notaion
```

You will get `NaN` when you try to calculate 0 / 0, `Infinity - Infinity`, or any number of other numeric operations that don't yield a meaningful result.

It (`+`) does not add, but it concatenates -- it glues two strings together.

```javascript
console.log(`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`);
// `${100 / 2}` => 50
```

```javascript
console.log(typeof 4.5);
// -> number
```

```javascript
console.log(NaN == NaN);
// -> false
```

```javascript
console.log(true ? 1 : 2); // 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2); // 2
```

```javascript
console.log(null || "user"); // -> user
console.log("Agnes" || "user"); // -> Agnes
console.log(false || "anything"); // anything, false can be 0
console.log(true || "anything"); // 1, true can be non-zero
```

```javascript
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(false && "anything"); // false
```

### Chapter 2:  Program Structure

A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression.

```javascript
let a = 10;
var a = 10;
const a = 10; // the same
```

```javascript
let nationalDay = 10.1; // naming style
```

```javascript
do {

} while();
        
/* */

switch () {
    case "":
    break;
    case "":
    break;
}
```

### Chapter 3: Functions

Functions that don't have a `return` statement at all, similarly return `undefined`.

Function declarations are not part of the regular top-to-bottom flow of control.

```javascript
const square1 = (x) => { return x * x };
const square2 = x => x * x;
```

```javascript
const horn = () => {
    console.log("Hihi");
}
```

A pure function has the pleasant property that, when called with the same arguments, it always produces the same value.

### Chapter 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays

When using a dot, the word after the dot is the literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is evaluated to get the property name.

The elements in an array are stored as the array's properties, using numbers as property names.

Properties that contain functions are generally called methods of the value they belong to, as in `toUpperCase` is a method of a string.

The `push` method adds values to the end of an array, and the `pop` method does the opposite, removing the last value in the array and returning it.

A stack, in programming, is a data structure that allows you to push values into it and pop them out again in the opposite order so that the thing that was added last is removed first.

... immutable -- it is impossible to change values of those types.

Rest Parameters: `...numbers`

```javascript
functions max(...numbers) {
    let result = -Infinity;
    for (let number of numbers) {
        if (number > result) result = number;
    }
    return result;
}
console.log(max(5, 1, 5));
// -> 5

let words = ["never", "fully"];
console.log(["will", ...words, "understand"]);
```
