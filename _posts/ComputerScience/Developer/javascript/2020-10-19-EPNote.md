# Notes

## Eloquent JavaScript

### Introduction

The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity.

A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules. 

```javascript
// sum up from 1 to 10
let total = 0,
  count = 1;

while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count++;
}

console.log(total);
```
