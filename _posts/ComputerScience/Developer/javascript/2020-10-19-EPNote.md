# Notes

## Eloquent JavaScript

### Introduction

The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity.

A sense of what a good program looks like is developed in practice, not learned from a list of rules.

```javascript
// sum up from 1 to 10
let total = 0,
  count = 1;

while (count <= 10) {
  total += count;
  count++;
}

console.log(total);
```

A good programming language helps the programmer by allowing them to talk about the actions that the computer has to perform on a higher level.

### Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators

Bits are any kind of two-valued things, usually described as zero and ones.

```javascript
2.998e8; // scientific notaion
```

You will get `NaN` when you try to calculate 0 / 0, `Infinity - Infinity`, or any number of other numeric operations that don't yield a meaningful result.

It (`+`) does not add, but it concatenates -- it glues two strings together.

```javascript
console.log(`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`);
// `${100 / 2}` => 50
```

```javascript
console.log(typeof 4.5);
// -> number
```

```javascript
console.log(NaN == NaN);
// -> false
```

```javascript
console.log(true ? 1 : 2); // 1
console.log(false ? 1 : 2); // 2
```

```javascript
console.log(null || "user"); // -> user
console.log("Agnes" || "user"); // -> Agnes
console.log(false || "anything"); // anything, false can be 0
console.log(true || "anything"); // 1, true can be non-zero
```

```javascript
console.log(true && false); // false
console.log(false && "anything"); // false
```
