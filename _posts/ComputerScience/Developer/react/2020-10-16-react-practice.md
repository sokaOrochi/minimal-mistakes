As the language and the framework my employee using is **Javascript** and **React native**, I am starting my first development project based on these two things. Therefore, I start web logging the whole study path of learning **React** progress, also I got some interesting idea may apply in real life with React. :)

I lock up the time consuming of this so-called project within 3 months, which starts from **2020-10-17** to **2021-1-17**. The final target is I am capable to **create any website based on React without any problem**.

The strategy here is **project-based** method. Set the goal for each stage (except the planning stage), and the make it come true with a real world project. It is beneficial for double-checking whether I am totally master those perspectives in this stage, and also printable in resume.

# Questions

1. I have no idea where to start. Therefore, I should scratch up a plan.
2. How can I duplicate the full-stack technical perspectives of Tudis's project? Like, Strapi, Postgresql, React...

# To do list

1. Make up a plan for the study progress in the following three months. (2020-10-17 to 2020-10-19)

   1. Books? ->

      Javascript books:

      ```shell
      ${HOME}/Documents/github_page/react/books/javaScript/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf
      ```

      React books:

      ```shell
      ${HOME}/Documents/github_page/react/books
      ```

   2. Roadmap? ->
      1. [React Learning Path in 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9Qx2Xef0do&t=27s): I can get a bunch of terminology in each React tech point, exactly. What I can learn from this video is tackling down each point one by one. Or Maybe when I follow the content from books, I can also have chance to learn these tech-points.
      2. [React JS Roadmap for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip_jOSpThSg&t=399s): Comparing with React Learning Path in 2020, Adrian add up more skills we should know before and after React, such as HTML, CSS, Git... and which child tech point we can divided from React, like React 360, Electron...
      3. [The 2020 React.js Developer RoadMap](https://hackernoon.com/the-2020-reactjs-developer-roadmap-8q143yan): React.js is a library of Javascript, I should get deeper in Javascript first.

# Progress

## Step 1: The Big Picture (A.K.A Roadmap)

### Duration

2020-10-17 to 2020-10-19

### Target

A study plan for the next three months, including

1. what I should know
2. how deep I ought to know in each domain

### Outcome

This should be a x-mind map attachment. It is not as detail as the tutorial I follow, but I should at least know that this React function or technology exists already.

```shell
${HOME}/Documents/github_page/react/reactRoadmap
```

## Stage 2: Project-based for each tech-point

### Duration

2020-10-18 to 2021-1-17

### Target

Start project-based study method for each tech-point, based on the React Roadmap x-mind file.

2020-10-18 - ... : Master Javascript: I should get a textbook first.

```shell
${HOME}/Documents/github_page/react/books/javaScript
```

### Outcome

javaScript project = [javaScript](https://github.com/sokaOrochi/react-practice/tree/master/javaScript) -> **Working On...**

# What is next?

Tack down each tech point I planned, and apply them in my real world project o-called **Macau Amateur Ally**.
