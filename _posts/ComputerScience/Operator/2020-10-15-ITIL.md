As my "future employer" asks me to know more about IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) for preparing well the works coming up. This post is recording the process of what I self-study about ITIL ® 4. I may take some notes first, then I am capable to introduce systemically about my research outcome later.

# Questions 

## @ Ground Zero

1. What is ITIL?
   1. ITIL® 4 is the framework for delivering IT services, pronounced by Axelos.
2. When and where should I apply ITIL ® 4 framework?
   1. Get to know by case study.
3. How to learn ITIL ® 4?
   1. Get in touch with the basic knowledge.
      1. *ITIL® Foundation, ITIL 4 edition*

      3. *ITIL® 4 Drive Stakeholder Value*
      4. *ITIL® 4 High-velocity IT*

4. What is the relationship between ITIL and my past working experience?
5. What is the relationship between ITIL and my future title (Devops)?

## Follow up

1. Relationship between ITIL and ITSM?
2. Should I learn more about Design Thinking, DevOps, and Agile methodologies?

I hope I can answer these questions after my research, and maybe this question list will get longer during my study pace.
